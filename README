Mysql::NameLocker
=================

Description
-----------
This is an object wrapper for MySQL's named locks. Using this
object in code is safe because as soon as the object goes out of scope,
the lock is automatically released. This is especially important in
mod_perl scripts, daemons, and any other persistent code.
I've included a HTML version of the POD docs in the html subdirectory.
